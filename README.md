# Contributing

Install the firebase cli tools from npm in order to run the local server.

Run `npm start` to start the local server.
Run `npm run watch` to bundle the code and continue watching for incremental builds.
Run `npm run lint` and make sure there are no linting errors or warnings in your changes prior to making a pull request.

Since browser support for tab-spacing is poor, spaces (not tabs) should be used in all of the code for the examples on the website. This means any code within `src/examples/` should be indented with spaces. All code anywhere else should be indented using tabs.
